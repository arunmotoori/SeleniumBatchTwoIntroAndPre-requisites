		<hr><br><br>My name is Arun Motoori.<br><br><br><hr/>I love HTML. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.<hr/>HTML is used for creating structure of web pages. 
		CSS is required to be used along with HTML for Styling.<hr>
		JavaScript needs to be used for making the webelements on the web pages dynamic.<hr>
		I also love Java programming.<hr> For Selenium Test Automaiton we have to learn only core java part. <hr>
		We don't have to learn Advanced Java for Selenium Test Automation. <hr>
		Till Collections Framework one has to learn Core Java. <hr/>
		For any one who is getting started with Selenium Automation, they have to start learning Selenium using Java, thought there are other supported programing languages like Python, C#, Ruby, JavaScript etc.<hr>
